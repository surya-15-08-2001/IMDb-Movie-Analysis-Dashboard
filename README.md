# IMDb-Movie-Analysis-Dashboard

In this project, I have designed a dashboard consisting of six objectives using 
the IMDb movies analysis (2006-2016) dataset. 

The reason for choosing this IMDb dataset is basically I am a movie buff. I used 
to see the movies which has a higher IMDb rating. While searching for the 
dataset, I came across many datasets but I felt this IMDb topic was something 
interesting and unique. So, I chose this as my dataset.

I have listed all my six objectives below: -
1) Top 5 revenue generated movies every year.
2) Count of different genre movies released every year.
3) Top 3 movies with highest running time every year.
4) Total sum of votes received for different genre every year.
5) Top 5 movies with highest metascore every year.
6) Top 3 highest rated IMDb movies every year.
